Battleground
=============

This is a game in development by three students at the University of Agder in Norway. Battleground is a strategy based game, where each player picks a fighter that will be used to compete against the other player. Each fighter has unique abilities and starting attributes which gives the opportunity to play with different styles. The attributes can be upgraded during the course of the game, by giving the fighters items. Items are received through a mystery chest, or can be purchased in the store with the in-game currency. Currency is also obtained through the mystery chests, and is also obtained at the end of each fight. In order to be good at the game, player's must develop strategies based on which attribute to upgrade, and by adapting to the opponent's choices.
