Battleground

This is a game in development by 3 students at the University of Agder in Norway. Battleground is a strategy based game, where players pick fighters and give these fighters attributes. Then players use these fighters to compete against each other. The player that wins is rewarded more ingame currency and can use this to upgrade attributes of a chosen fighter.
